# Project Part 4 : Usability Test

Given the prototype developed in [Part 3](Project/Part_3_Description.md), create and perform a usability test.

This includes:
- Planning a usability test
  - How many users?
  - What are we testing for?
    - How user-friendly our design is.
  - The script
    - General tasks
    - Specific tasks
      - Example: What is the first thing you want to do on the home page?
    - Final questions
  - Roles
    - Test Runner (issues the tasks, keeps question answering on track)
    - Observer (watches and writes notes)
    - User (completes tasks)
  - Tasks
  - What are we measuring?
    - 1-5 Intuativeness
  - Problem severity given measurement
    - Example: 1-2 is a fault in the design and should be either replaced or removed.
- Performing a usability test
  - Issuing tasks to users and observing their reactions
  - Asking questions of users and noting their responses
