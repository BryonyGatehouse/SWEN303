# Project Part 2 : Project Initial Design

Given the project proposal from [Part 1](Project/Part_1_Description.md), design an initial design and explain the design choices.

This included:
- Use Cases
  - What the personas/users can do with the system.
- Scenarios
  - For each scenario:
    - The reason it should be included in the solution.
    - A description of its function.
    - How each persona would approach it.
    - The use case steps.
    - Any notes to make the use case steps easier to understand.
- Design
  - The story board
    - The links between each page.
    - The areas only accessible with privilege (i.e. logged in, age restrictions).
  - Layout of each page
    - An image of how the page.
    - Explainations for why aspects were placed or used.
      - Example: The logo is placed in the top-left corner as users tend to read the page left to right, top to bottom. This makes sure the logo is the first thing the user sees.
   - Colour Scheme Options
      - Why colours were chosen.
      - Multiple examples of colour schemes.
      - An explaination for how the colours are used on the web page.
- Reflection 
  - Explaination of why my design would work for the design brief.
  - Explaination of problems with my design.
  - What I learnt and would do differently next time.
