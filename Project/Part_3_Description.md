# Project Part 3 : Combining Designs

Given the designs created in [Part 2](Part_2_Description.md), work together with four groups (either one or two people per group) to combine the designs.

This included:
- Personas
  - Choosing to focus on a few of the personas.
  - Editing the chosen personas to make them more diverse
    - Example: "Joseph" was modified to be colour-blind. This meant it was taken into consideration through the design process and made the final product more accessible.
