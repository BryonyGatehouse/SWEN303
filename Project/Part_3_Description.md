# Project Part 3 : Combining Designs

Given the designs created in [Part 2](Part_2_Description.md), work together with four groups (either one or two people per group) to combine the designs.

This included:
- Personas
  - Choosing to focus on a few of the personas.
  - Editing the chosen personas to make them more diverse.
    - Example: "Joseph" was modified to be colour-blind. This meant it was taken into consideration through the design process and made the final product more accessible.
- Scenarios
  - Creating new scenarios based on the new personas and the application intent.
- Design Review
  - Review of each team's prototype (design from Part 2).
    - Used a Cognitive Walkthrough approach where each participant explores the design without any explainations or justifications of the interface. 
    - Afterwards the creator explains their design, with discussion about certain design choices.
- Prototype
  - Explaining the following:
    - Colour Scheme
    - Layout for certain pages
    - Use of particular aspects
- Group Refelction
  - The result of the merging process
  - The best parts of the prototype
  - The worst parts of the prototype
- Personal Reflection
  - Things to take away from this
  - Things to stop doing
